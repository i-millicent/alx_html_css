## üìù Description

This project documents the process of recreating the design of a popular website using Figma. The goal is to replicate the site's user interface (UI), focusing on typography, color palette, component design, and layout. This is intended to be a hands-on learning exercise to improve my skills in UI design and design-system thinking.

## üéØ Objectives

*   **Deconstruct a real-world design:** Analyze and break down a live website to understand its fundamental design elements.
*   **Create a component-based design:** Recreate the website's components in Figma, such as buttons, navigation bars, and cards, to build a reusable design system.
*   **Master Figma features:** Utilize Figma's powerful tools, including Auto Layout, Variants, and Styles, to create a clean, organized, and scalable design file.
*   **Analyze and adapt:** Make thoughtful decisions about how to handle different screen sizes and user interactions, going beyond a simple static copy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

*   **Figma:** The primary design and prototyping tool used for the entire project.

## üöÄ My Approach

### Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation
*   **Identify the target website:** Choose a website that features interesting and well-structured design patterns.
*   **Initial research:** Take screenshots of the website's key pages on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Asset collection:** Use a browser extension to extract the website's color palette, typography, and collect any imagery or iconography used.

### Phase 2: Building the Figma Design System
*   **Set up the project:** Create a new Figma file and organize it with a clear page structure (`Cover`, `Components`, `Screens`, etc.).
*   **Create styles:** Define color and typography styles for the project to ensure consistency.
*   **Build components:** Recreate atomic UI elements first, like buttons and form inputs, before moving on to more complex components like cards and headers. Use Auto Layout to ensure components are responsive.
*   **Use variants:** Group similar components (e.g., button states like `:hover` or `:disabled`) into variants for easy management and prototyping.

### Phase 3: Recreating Pages
*   **Start with the smallest screen:** Design for mobile first, as this helps to prioritize content and establish a strong foundation.
*   **Recreate key pages:** Build out the main pages of the website using the components created in Phase 2.
*   **Add responsiveness:** Use Figma's resizing constraints and Auto Layout to ensure the design adapts gracefully to larger viewports.

### Phase 4: Prototyping (Optional)
*   **Add interactions:** Connect the designed screens with interactive flows to simulate the user experience.
*   **Document findings:** Note any challenges faced during the recreation process and insights gained from the design decisions of the original site.
